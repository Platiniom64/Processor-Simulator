# Processor-Simulator
This was a coursework done for University.

I created a simulator for a 5-stage multi-cycle MIPS processor.
I also tested different types of caches: associative, fully associative and 

mipssim.c is the main file.
memory_hierarchy.c is the memory hierarchy implementation
parser.h is for the reading and parsing of input files.

The "memfile-*.txt" consists of the MIPS instructions and data.
the "regfile_*.txt" constains the state of the registers at the start of execution.
